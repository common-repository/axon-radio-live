== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can we start Axon Radio Live with the music unmuted? =

The Axon Radio Live widget always starts playing automatically while displaying featured artwork. However, audio is muted so that it does not interfere with other media on your site. This is also to reduce user annoyance. Users must unmute the audio to listen to the live broadcast.
